# Simultaneous Equation Solver (For both Real and Complex Numbers)

Anyone dealing with AC Circuits in their EEE Courses may find this handy ->
I have built this Simultaneous Equation Solver which supports Complex Numbers as coefficients and constants.
I have also added string to number parsing in it so that one can write the coefficients just as they are in the textbooks.
For example you can write 
(3+4i(5/(-3-j7))-4i*(3/6))/(-2+8i)
as a coefficient or a constant and it will parse it into a simplified form itself.

1. Download the file and run the "Simultaneous Equation Solver.exe" file.
2. Coefficients and constants can be real / complex.
3. You may input them in r-theta format like this: 2<90 (Modulus<Argument). Arguments MUST be in degree format.
4. Do not put any spaces in a coefficient / constant term.
5. Put parentheses in an ordered manner and avoid extra braces otherwise the program won't work.
6. You may use either 'i' or 'j' as the imaginary unit.
7. Procedures are quite identical to those of a Scientific Calculator. String to simplified number parsing follows BODMAS rule so you don't need to worry much.

It was built within a very short time and there may be bugs. And this is console. Feel free to report errors, bugs or any suggestion regarding its improvement. And In Sha Allah the Android App version will be provided within a day or two.

P.S : I know we cannot use it in the exam hall but it is obviously useful and saves a lot of time in case we are practicing AC Circuit Analysis at home.
